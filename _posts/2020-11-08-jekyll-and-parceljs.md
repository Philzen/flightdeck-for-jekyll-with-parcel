Flightdeck is just a starter project using [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) as a bundler and asset compiler. You'll find Jekyll under the hood with the Minima theme as well as [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/), [Imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-plugin-imagemin), [SVG sprite generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-sprite-generator), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), Sass with PostCSS support
